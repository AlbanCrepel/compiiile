## It can contain some lists

-   My first list item
-   A second list item

## ðŸ“š Expose your ideas

> ðŸ’¡ Just use the language and framework you want in your developer course, and don't impose your ideas.

## How about some code ?

```javascript
console.log("I prefer using this than the actual debugger")
```

I forgot to showcase once again the poorly-designed logo of Compiiile:

![compiiile-logo|200px](./.compiiile/public/favicon.png)

(it's using a nice font though)
