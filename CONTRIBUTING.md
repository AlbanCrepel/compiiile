# Contributing

Contributions are welcome in this project, and they will be appreciated. But they ***must*** come ***after*** discussing it by creating an issue.

**Not all** contributions will be accepted. The goal of Compiiile is not to reproduce existing projects and add a lot of features to cover all use cases. 

Whether, we will always aim to keep the code base and features simple.

## Roadmap

Here is the current roadmap and feature ideas for incoming releases:
- [ ] being able to resize the navbar
- [ ] handling HMR (Hot Module Reloading) when running the `dev` command to refresh the markdown content and any added file
- [ ] tag files with frontmatter and search files having specific tags
- [ ] use custom vue components in markdown (like `MDX`)
- [ ] Make a theme switcher and make custom themes available to others (load external CSS)
- [ ] rewrite the whole thing in TypeScript and use Tailwind if I am ever motivated
- [ ] add some markdown-it plugins (Mermaid ? Any ideas from you ?)

If a fix needs to be done or your contributing idea is part of this roadmap, it will most likely be taken into account.

People should also understand that I am not working full-time on this project and that deadlines will never be set for a feature to be implemented.

## Launching the project locally

You can launch a local version of the project by cloning the repository, installing the dependencies (with `yarn install`, and use these 3 commands):
- `yarn dev`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn preview`
